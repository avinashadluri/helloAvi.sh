Below is the expanded plan to enhance the blog experience end to end. Every tab reads like a named product line so the site feels like a launchpad of signature experiences rather than a flat collection of posts.

## Core Navigation Pillars

### Home → "Orbit Hub"

#### About Me → “Dual Worlds”

- Layout: toggle between “Professional World” and “Personal World” using the content below (sourced/adapted from `avinash.sh/app/page.tsx`).

```md
##### Professional World

Fifteen-plus years of building for the web taught me that clarity beats cleverness. I started in Mumbai, sharpened my craft in Hyderabad, and now call Sydney home. TypeScript is my primary language, and lately every stack I touch gets an AI co-pilot.

**Atlassian · Senior Software Engineer**

- Led design systems adopted by 100+ teams, enforcing accessibility and consistency.
- Cut CI/CD times by 70% by rebuilding pipelines and release playbooks.
- Championed micro-frontend patterns to unblock independent shipping.

**Weel / Stealth FinTech · Staff Engineer**

- Shipped AI-native tooling for finance workflows.
- Owned developer-experience guardrails that kept a small team shipping fast.

**Bugcrowd · Tech Lead**

- Modernized the security platform UI and observability stack.
- Mentored 20+ engineers; team velocity improved by 40%.

**Cognizant & Valuepitch · Tech Lead / Software Engineer**

- Ran large re-platforming programmes for banks.
- Balanced onsite/offshore execution while coaching junior engineers.

**Leadership philosophy**: Engineer with radical clarity, mentor generously, and leave processes kinder for the next builder. I speak at community meetups, curate PromptLib, and run workshops on AI-assisted product development.
```

```md
##### Personal World

I grew up in a Telugu household where poetry was currency. That love became `nishabdham.sh`, my space for verse, essays, and storytelling experiments. Moving to Australia taught me to blend ambition with empathy—the coastline is where most ideas land.

Family is the core operating system. Gouthami keeps the rhythm, while Aadhya and Arjun turn weekends into curiosity labs with Lego rockets, short films, and photography walks. We build together, learn together, and archive everything.

“Work, Think, Create” is my guiding loop. Work: build dependable systems. Think: protect quiet time through meditation and astronomy. Create: publish poetry, host storytelling nights, and document Sydney life through film.
