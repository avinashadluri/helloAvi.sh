# Engineering Pods · JS & Frontend Systems

Building resilient interfaces today means treating frontend as a system, not a single repo. This playbook captures the pods I'm running inside the **NeuroStack Engineering Deck**.

## 1. JS Ecosystem State of the Union

| Layer | 2025 Pick | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundler | Vite + Rsbuild hybrid | Vite for DX, Rsbuild for enterprise perf. |
| Runtime | Next.js App Router + Cloudflare Workers | SSR where it matters, edge for personalization. |
| Type Safety | TypeScript 5.x + Type Challenges | Strict config + programmatic schema generation. |
| Styling | Tailwind + Panda + design tokens | Tokens enforced via Style Dictionary + ESLint. |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright + Storybook interactions | Unified reports piped into Buildkite. |

## 2. Micro Frontends Playbook

### Team Topology
- **Core platform pod** owns design system, tokens, and shared API contracts.
- **Feature pods** ship independently via Module Federation or edge-deployed widgets.
- **Experience pod** monitors UX observability (Core Web Vitals, UX metrics from Replay.io).

### Composition Patterns
1. **Shell + Slices** (Next.js shell + lazy remote slices).
2. **Widget mesh** (Edge-hosted widgets embedded via capability tokens).
3. **Story-driven docs** (Every slice has MDX docs, replay, and contract tests).

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Shadow design systems per pod.
- Runtime dependency collisions (use `@module-federation/manifest`).
- Shipping without synthetic monitoring at composition boundaries.

## 3. Systems in the Wild

| Engagement | What we shipped | Key learning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atlassian DS revamp | Multi-brand theme tokens + component profiling | Token pipelines must be observable. |
| Bugcrowd UI refresh | Micro frontend migration + SSO hardening | Edge auth proxies simplify per-tenant theming. |
| Thinki.sh | Static/interactive hybrid docs | Treat MDX as source-of-truth for product thinking. |

## 4. Trend Radar

- **React Server Components**: great for streaming dashboards; wrap with `swr` fallback for resilience.
- **WASM-in-the-UI**: Piloting AssemblyScript validators for offline-first flows.
- **AI-assisted DX**: Cursor + custom Copilot instructions for design-system linting.
- **Design Token APIs**: Using `Style Dictionary` + GraphQL to serve tokens to native apps.

## 5. How to Use this Pod

1. Start with the state-of-the-union table to align stacks.
2. Apply the micro frontend patterns that match your org topology.
3. Reference real engagements to de-risk rollouts.
4. Keep an eye on the radar; I update it monthly based on experiments inside MetaLabs + client work.
