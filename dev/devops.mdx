# Trend Radar · Platform Stewardship

This log keeps the DevOps/platform signals I’m acting on. Use it as a briefing before planning quarters or tooling investments.

## 1. Signals on My Radar

| Signal | Why it matters | Current experiment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React Server Components | Streaming UX + reduced hydration costs | Using in MetaLabs dashboards with fallback islands. |
| Edge Runtimes (Workers, Deno) | Close to user, low latency, built-in isolation | Running agent webhooks on Cloudflare Workers + durable objects. |
| AI-assisted DX | Copilots accelerate repeatable tasks but need guardrails | Custom instructions for Cursor + GitHub Copilot to enforce design tokens + test scaffolds. |
| Rsbuild / Turbopack hybrids | Dramatic build-time improvements | Paired with Vite for best-of-both worlds pipeline. |
| Cost Observability | FinOps is part of DevOps | Pump AWS Cost & Usage data into Metabase dashboards with budgets per product. |

## 2. Platform Stewardship Principles

1. **Every workflow documented** – CLI recordings + Loom to onboard next engineer.
2. **Golden paths** – Template repos for services, micro frontends, n8n automations.
3. **Guardrails over gates** – Linting, typegen, contract tests run automatically; humans focus on narrative reviews.
4. **Measure developer joy** – Quarterly surveys, DORA metrics, friction logs.

## 3. Golden Path Catalog

- **`create-neurostack-app`** – spins up Next.js + tRPC + Turso with infra-as-code.
- **`svc-template`** – Express/Nest service with OpenTelemetry + SLO starter.
- **`automation-starter`** – n8n workflow plus Git-based deployment (productivity use cases).

## 4. Quarterly Checkpoint Template

### Platform OKR Review
- What slowed teams?
- Which guardrails saved time?
- Runway of tech debt (days)?
- Cost-per-product vs SLO budgets?
- Next-quarter bets?
```

## 5. How to Engage

- Drop questions in the GitHub Discussions board (`#platform-stewardship`).
- Request a pairing session if you’re planning a new pod; we’ll co-design the guardrails.
- Share radar signals back—this page is living documentation.
