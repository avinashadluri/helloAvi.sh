# SLI Recipes

Indicators are the ingredients of a good SLO. Here are the ones we rely on most.

## 1. Latency
- **Definition**: time from request receipt to successful response (p50/p90/p95).
- **Implementation**: OpenTelemetry spans with `http.server.duration`, aggregated in Prometheus.
- **Dashboard**: contrast vs Core Web Vitals (frontend) and API calls.

## 2. Reliability / Error Rate
- **Definition**: `(failed requests / total requests)` per service + endpoint.
- **Implementation**: HTTP status buckets, GraphQL errors, workflow job failures.
- **Tip**: separate user errors vs platform errors to avoid noisy metrics.

## 3. Freshness / Data Lag
- **Definition**: time between source event and availability in consumer system.
- **Use case**: Productivity dashboards fed from automations; Thinki.sh community stats.
- **Implementation**: event timestamp vs ingest timestamp; alert if > threshold.

## 4. Business Outcomes
- **Definition**: completion rate of key workflows (productivity ritual, AI agent task, Thinki.sh challenge).
- **Implementation**: Fire event to Segment/PostHog; compute ratio vs started.
- **Note**: great for product-led SLOs.

## 5. Experience Metrics
- **Frontend**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) via Web-Vitals JS + Analytics.
- **Mobile**: App start time, error-free sessions (Sentry), offline success rate.

## 6. Storage + Queue Health
- Useful for n8n and automation heavy flows.
- Track backlog size, oldest message age, failure retries.
