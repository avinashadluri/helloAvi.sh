# Service Level Indicators

SLIs quantify how well a service is performing from the user’s perspective. Good SLIs are:

- **Representative** of real user journeys
- **Quantifiable** and automatically measurable
- **Controlled** by the team that owns the service

---

## Choosing SLIs

1. Map critical user actions.
2. Identify the signals that describe success or failure.
3. Instrument the application to collect those signals.

---

## Examples

**Frontend**

- LCP p75
- JS error rate
- API call p95 latency

**Backend**

- Request success rate
- Availability
- Queue length

**Business**

- Checkout success ratio
- Sign-up conversion

---

## Implementing SLIs

```typescript
import { onLCP } from 'web-vitals';

onLCP(metric => {
  navigator.sendBeacon('/rum', JSON.stringify({ name: metric.name, value: metric.value }));
});
```

Use a single export path for SLIs so dashboards and alerts stay consistent.

---

## Reviewing SLIs

- Track trends over time
- Correlate with incidents
- Retire SLIs that no longer map to user value
