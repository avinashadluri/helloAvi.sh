# Observability Basics

Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state from its external outputs.
This guide covers the foundations you need before diving into SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs.

---

## The Three Pillars

- **Logs** – immutable event records. Useful for debugging and auditing.
- **Metrics** – numeric measurements over time. Ideal for dashboards and alerting.
- **Traces** – end-to-end request paths. Useful for understanding latency and dependencies.

---

## Telemetry Pipeline

1. Instrument code with open standards such as [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io).
2. Export data to a collector or agent.
3. Store data in a backend (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.).
4. Visualise and alert with dashboards.

---

## Key Practices

- **Contextual logging** – include correlation IDs and user info.
- **High-cardinality metrics** – carefully label; avoid unbounded labels.
- **Sampling** – control volume of traces and logs to manage cost.
- **Retention & compliance** – define how long telemetry is stored.

Once you understand the basics, dive into the specific guides on
SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs to tie observability to reliability commitments.
