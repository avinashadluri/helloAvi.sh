# Observability Galaxy · Primer

Before diving into playbooks and tooling, this primer explains how I treat observability inside AviEngine and FlowOS.

## 1. Vocabulary
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** – External promise; contractual.
- **SLO (Service Level Objective)** – Internal target; drives engineering focus.
- **SLI (Service Level Indicator)** – Measurable metric (latency, errors, freshness, etc.).
- **Error Budget** – 1 - SLO. Spend it intentionally on launches, migrations, experiments.

## 2. Telemetry Pillars
1. **Logs** – Structured JSON shipped via OpenTelemetry → Vector → Loki.
2. **Metrics** – Prometheus + CloudWatch, aggregated into Honeycomb and Grafana dashboards.
3. **Traces** – OpenTelemetry tracing, correlated with session replay for frontend contexts.

## 3. Dashboard Anatomy
- Executive view: SLA compliance, uptime, cost overlay.
- Pod view: SLO burn-down, top incidents, regression alerts.
- Feature view: specific FlowOS workflow or Sentience Studio agent performance.

## 4. Rituals
- **Daily**: Check burn rates via Slack digest.
- **Weekly**: Incident narrative review (see `dev/observability.mdx`).
- **Monthly**: Cost observability sync—compare spend vs value.
