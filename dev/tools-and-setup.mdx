# Systems in the Wild · Toolchains

Consider this the field journal for the NeuroStack deck—real implementations, stack choices, and what I’d repeat or avoid.

## Atlassian · Design System Acceleration

- **Stack**: Yarn workspaces, Storybook, Vite, Chromatic, Playwright visual tests.
- **Key Moves**:
  - Created token pipeline (Style Dictionary → Figma → codegen).
  - Automated release notes + change logs per component.
  - Observability tie-in: Lighthouse CI + Sentry performance budgets.
- **Lesson**: Invest in docs-as-code (MDX) so 100+ teams can self-serve.

## Bugcrowd · Security Platform Refresh

- **Stack**: Next.js, Module Federation, GraphQL Mesh, LaunchDarkly, Datadog RUM.
- **Key Moves**:
  - Built incremental migration path: legacy Ember ↔ new React host.
  - Added feature flag hygiene checklist tied to SLO budgets.
  - Embedded SRE partner in UI pod for joint incident reviews.
- **Lesson**: Micro frontends succeed only if incident tooling is shared.

## MetaLabs / FlowOS · Builder Lab

- **Stack**: Next.js App Router, Turbo Repo, Prisma + PlanetScale, n8n, Supabase Auth.
- **Key Moves**:
  - Created "FlowOS Rituals" content pipeline (Notion → MDX → site).
  - Wired OpenAI + Anthropic agents with eval harness (LangSmith).
  - Added background jobs via Cloudflare Queues for automations.
- **Lesson**: Treat content + automations as first-class packages (versioned, tested).

## Tooling Checklist

| Layer | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package manager | pnpm | Workspace friendly, strict lockfiles. |
| Linting | ESLint + Biome | TS + MDX linting with consistent formatting. |
| CI | GitHub Actions + Buildkite | GH for lint/unit, BK for heavy integration suites. |
| Secrets | Doppler + AWS Parameter Store | Works across local + prod. |
| Monitoring | OpenTelemetry → Honeycomb/Grafana/Sentry | Same schema for frontend + backend. |
