# Service Level Objectives

SLOs define the reliability targets for your service. They bridge the gap between raw SLIs and external SLAs.

---

## Anatomy of an SLO

- **Metric** – which SLI is being targeted.
- **Threshold** – the numeric goal (e.g., 99.95% availability).
- **Time window** – the period over which it is measured.

---

## Error Budgets

```
error_budget = 1 - SLO
```

The error budget quantifies how much unreliability is acceptable. When the budget is exhausted:

- Pause risky releases
- Focus on reliability work
- Communicate status to stakeholders

---

## Defining SLOs Step by Step

1. Start from user journeys.
2. Pick the most critical SLIs for each journey.
3. Choose an achievable target with historical data.
4. Set the measurement window (rolling 30 days, calendar month, etc.).
5. Document owners and review cadence.

## Example SLOs

| Service            | SLI             | SLO            |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| API Gateway        | Availability    | 99.95% monthly |
| Search             | p95 latency     | ≤300ms         |
| Checkout           | Success rate    | ≥99.8%         |
| Frontend LCP       | LCP p75         | ≤2.5s          |

---

## Operating with SLOs

- Plot burn rate dashboards.
- Alert on fast-burn conditions (e.g., 2% of budget consumed in 1 hour).
- Review SLOs quarterly to ensure they still reflect user expectations.
