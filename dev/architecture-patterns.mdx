# Frontend Architecture Blueprints

The blueprints below power AviEngine builds. Mix and match depending on team size and target platform.

## 1. Feature-Sliced + Domain-Driven

```text
src/
 ├─ app/ (routing, layouts)
 ├─ entities/ (domain models)
 ├─ features/ (user-facing capabilities)
 ├─ widgets/ (composite UI blocks)
 └─ shared/ (design system, utilities)
```

- Use barrel files per slice; forbid cross-imports with ESLint `boundaries` plugin.
- Document each slice with MDX (purpose, owners, telemetry hooks).

## 2. Design-System-First Delivery
- Tokens live in `packages/tokens` with Style Dictionary + Figma sync.
- Component packages expose `@avi/ui` with tree-shakeable exports.
- Every feature PR lists the component IDs touched; helps with changelog + release train.

## 3. React Excellence Checklist
- Prefer Server Components for data-heavy sections; wrap with client boundaries for interactions.
- Use Suspense + `use` for streaming; provide fallback skeletons instrumented with Web Vitals.
- Co-locate mutations via server actions; validate with Zod + return typed results.
- Snapshot tests minimized; rely on Storybook interaction tests + visual regression.

## 4. REST + GraphQL Rigor
- Versioned REST via path (v1/v2) + header for early adopters.
- Pagination defaults: cursor-based; include `hasNext`, `timestamp`.
- Error contracts: `code`, `message`, `docsLink`, `traceId`.
- GraphQL schema linted with `graphql-schema-linter`, breaking change detector in CI.

## 5. Platform Stewardship Article Series
- **Platform guardrails**: CLI scaffolds, lint presets, doc templates.
- **DX Observability**: Collect `pnpm install` duration, test flake rates, PR cycle times.
- **Design token governance**: treat as code with preview links + sign-offs from design + eng.
