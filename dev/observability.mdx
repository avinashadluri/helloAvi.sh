# Incident Narratives & Cost Observability

Observability is more than dashboards; it’s storytelling plus cost awareness.

## 1. Incident Narrative Template

```text
### Context
- Date/time, impacted services, trigger.

### Customer Impact
- Who felt it? What symptoms?

### Timeline
- Detection → Mitigation → Resolution.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical, process, people.

### What Went Well
- Automation, observability, comms wins.

### Improvement Actions
- Owners + due dates + follow-up links.
```

- Narratives live in `/runbooks/incidents/[id].mdx` with tags (SLO, service, severity).
- Share summaries in weekly ops review + Slack #observability channel.

## 2. Blameless Culture Checklist
- Focus on systems, not individuals.
- Assign improvement actions within 48h.
- Review old actions monthly; close or re-scope.

## 3. Cost Observability
- Pipe AWS/GCP billing data into Metabase + Looker Studio.
- Tag resources per product (MetaLabs, productivity suite, AI lab) + environment.
- Create **Cost SLO**: e.g., "MetaLabs infra under $4.5k/month"; treat overruns like incidents.

## 4. Burn Rate Dashboard
- 1h, 6h, 24h burn charts with thresholds.
- Slack alerts when burn > 2x budget.
- Drill down by customer cohort to see who is impacted.

## 5. Toolchain
- OpenTelemetry Collector → Honeycomb traces.
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; exported to Datadog for exec view.
- CloudZero (or custom scripts) for FinOps automation.

Keep this doc handy during retro meetings or when you need to justify reliability investments.
