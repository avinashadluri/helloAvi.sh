# Observability Tools

A solid observability stack is a combination of collection agents, storage backends, and visualisation tools.

---

## Metrics

- **Prometheus** – scraping and storing time series data.
- **Grafana** – dashboards and alerting.
- **CloudWatch / Stackdriver** – managed metrics in the cloud.

## Logs

- **Loki / Elasticsearch** – log aggregation with structured search.
- **Fluent Bit** – lightweight log forwarding agent.
- **Sentry** – application error tracking.

## Traces

- **Jaeger / Tempo** – distributed tracing backends.
- **OpenTelemetry** – unified APIs and SDKs for traces, metrics, and logs.

## Real User Monitoring (RUM)

- **Datadog RUM** – browser and mobile instrumentation.
- **New Relic Browser** – frontend performance insights.

---

## Choosing Tools

When selecting tools consider:

- **Open standards** to avoid lock‑in.
- **Cost of storage and retention.**
- **Ease of integration** with your stack.
- **Community and ecosystem support.**

---

## Putting it together

Use OpenTelemetry to emit telemetry once, send it to an agent, then fan out to the tools above depending on your needs.
