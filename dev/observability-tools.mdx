# Observability Tooling & Stack

Here’s the toolbox supporting the Observability Galaxy.

## 1. Telemetry Ingest
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** – standardizes traces/logs/metrics.
- **Vector** – lightweight agent pushing logs to Loki/S3.
- **AWS Kinesis Firehose** – archival for compliance workloads.

## 2. Storage & Query
| Need | Tool | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics | Prometheus + CloudWatch | Open-source control + managed retention. |
| Logs | Loki + S3 Glacier | Cost-effective, query via Grafana + Athena. |
| Traces | Honeycomb | High-cardinality powerhouse for debugging. |
| Replay | Replay.io | Visual context for frontend incidents. |

## 3. Visualization & Alerting
- **Grafana** dashboards with SLO panels, burn charts, cost overlays.
- **Datadog** for exec-friendly dashboards and anomaly detection.
- **Slackbot** (custom) posting daily SLO + cost digests.
- **PagerDuty** integration with SLO alerts and on-call schedules.

## 4. Developer Experience
- `otel-cli` baked into template repos for quick instrumentation.
- VS Code snippets for adding SLIs to services.
- Runbook generator script scaffolds MDX for incidents.

## 5. Cost Observability Tooling
- **CloudZero** or **Finch** for spend allocation.
- Custom Metabase dashboards fed by CUR (Cost & Usage Reports).
- Alerts when spend deviates >10% week-over-week per product.

## 6. Getting Started
1. Add OpenTelemetry SDK to service (see template repo).
2. Configure Collector via Helm chart (`infra/observability` folder).
3. Create dashboards + alerts via Terraform modules.
4. Document in `/runbooks/observability/tools/[service].mdx`.

This stack evolves frequently; check the repo issues for upcoming experiments (e.g., Grafana Faro, SigNoz).
