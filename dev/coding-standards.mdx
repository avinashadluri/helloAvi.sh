# Best-Practice Codex · Coding Standards

This codex is what every pod in the NeuroStack deck signs up for. It’s lightweight, automatable, and proven across Atlassian, Bugcrowd, and MetaLabs builds.

## 1. Contracts Before Code
- RFC template in Notion + MDX artifact in repo (`/docs/rfcs/<slug>.mdx`).
- API/schema files generated from source-of-truth (OpenAPI, GraphQL SDL, Zod).
- All code samples in docs compile—use `markdownlint` + custom check to run snippets.

## 2. Linting Stack

| Layer | Tool | Rule of thumb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | TypeScript strict mode | `noImplicitAny`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. |
| Formatting | Biome (prev. Rome) | Replace Prettier + ESLint formatting for consistency. |
| UX | eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + custom rule for keyboard traps | Run in CI + pre-commit. |
| Security | eslint-plugin-security + Semgrep policy pack | Block PRs when secrets/hardcoded tokens appear. |

## 3. Review Rituals
1. PR title uses [Conventional Commits].
2. Description answers: Why? What changed? Testing notes? Rollback plan?
3. Screenshots/demo links for UI changes. Include Replay or Loom for complex flows.
4. Reviewer rotates weekly; enable `CODEOWNERS` + "shadow reviewer" for mentoring.

## 4. Definition of Done (per story)
- Tests added/updated (unit + integration + contract when API touched).
- Docs touched if behavior changes (MDX, Storybook, Runbook).
- Telemetry/SLO impact considered; dashboards updated.
- Feature flags + kill switches documented.

## 5. Measuring Adoption
- Monthly lint failure report (GitHub Insights) + auto-comment suggestions.
- Retro question: "Which standard saved you recently?" Collect stories to keep standards human.

Clone this codex into your own team charter and adapt names/owners, but keep the spirit: clarity first, automation second, storytelling third.
