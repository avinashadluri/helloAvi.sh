A compact guide to mastering people skills through learnable behaviors.

## The Core Idea

Success with people relies on practiced behaviors rather than innate charm. Like driving a car, interpersonal skills can be learned and refined to build trust and cooperation.

## Key Principles from *Skill With People*

1. **Everyone is Self-Interested** – People care most about themselves. View situations from their perspective and make them feel understood.
2. **Appreciation Beats Flattery** – Sincere praise builds real connections, while flattery feels hollow.
3. **Listen More, Talk Less** – Active listening makes others feel valued. Ask questions and show genuine curiosity.
4. **Make People Feel Important** – Use names, remember details, and solicit opinions to convey respect.
5. **Criticism is Dangerous** – Direct criticism breeds defensiveness. Offer praise before suggestions and preserve dignity.
6. **Influence Through Agreement** – Arguments harden positions. Find common ground first and build from there.
7. **The Law of Human Relations** – Treat others as you wish to be treated, while recognizing their desire for importance.
