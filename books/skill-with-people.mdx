# Skill with People · Notes

## Lessons
- **Names & stories matter** – Keep a People CRM (Notion) with personal details.
- **Listen past words** – Use reflective listening in mentorship + incidents.
- **Give honest appreciation** – Celebrate wins publicly, critique privately.

## Implementation
- Weekly "gratitude pings" to collaborators.
- Nishabdham interviews: prep empathetic questions.
- Leadership 1:1 template includes "How are you feeling?" check-in.

## Why it belongs here
Engineering success hinges on trust. This book keeps empathy in my practice.
