# Deep Work · Notes

## Principles I Keep
1. **Work deeply** – Schedule maker blocks before noon; defend them.
2. **Embrace boredom** – No context switching during focus sprints.
3. **Quit socials you don’t love** – Keep only channels that serve community building.
4. **Drain the shallows** – Batch admin tasks into the productivity "Admin" lane.

## Productivity Adaptations
- Maker/manager grid in Notion + Motion with energy tags.
- Shutdown ritual: log wins, plan tomorrow, disconnect.
- Metrics: track deep-work hours per week (aim for 15+).

## Companion Resources
- Deep Work playlist (instrumental) linked in the productivity template.
- Linear automation to block new work if deep work quota isn’t met.
