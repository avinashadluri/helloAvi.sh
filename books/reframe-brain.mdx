# Reframe Your Brain · Notes

## Core Takeaways
- **Systems over goals**: Build rituals (FlowOS) that compound regardless of outcome.
- **Skill stacking**: Combine tech, storytelling, mentoring for unfair advantage.
- **Reframes**: Replace "I have to" with "I get to experiment" to reduce stress.

## Tools I Adopted
- **Yet Mindset**: add "yet" to blockers (“I haven’t solved this yet.”).
- **Failure collect**: log lessons, not just wins.
- **Energy audit**: tag calendar entries with +/- to see trends.

## Application
- Thinki.sh challenges center on reframing prompts.
- Sentience Studio agents use reframing logic when coaching users.
