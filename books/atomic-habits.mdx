# Atomic Habits · Notes

## Four Laws Recap
1. **Make it obvious** – Environment cues for rituals.
2. **Make it attractive** – Pair work with rewards.
3. **Make it easy** – Reduce friction to start.
4. **Make it satisfying** – Immediate feedback loop.

## FlowOS Habit Examples
- Morning ritual card on kitchen counter (obvious).
- Pair journaling with espresso (attractive).
- Two-minute rule: open Notion + write one line (easy).
- Track streak in Notion + share in family chat (satisfying).

## AviWealth Tie-in
- Automate savings contributions (habit stacking with payday).
- Use visual cues (chart on wall) for debt payoff progress.
