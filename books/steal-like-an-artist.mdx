# Steal Like an Artist · Notes

## Why it matters
This book reminds me to remix influences openly—critical for Thinki.sh frameworks and Nishabdham poetry alike.

## Key Ideas
1. **Collect and Curate** – Keep a swipe file; credit your sources.
2. **Side Projects Matter** – Nishabdham experimentation feeds my engineering creativity.
3. **Create Scenius** – Share work-in-progress to attract collaborators.

## Exercises I Use
- `Daily Swipe`: capture one idea/image/line every day in Notion.
- `Remix Ritual`: pair a tech concept with a Telugu proverb, see what emerges.
- `Analog Mode`: spend 30 minutes writing/drawing on paper before touching screens.

## Activation
- FlowOS creators can clone my Notion template (linked in resource section).
- Pair this book with **Deep Work** to balance creativity + focus.
