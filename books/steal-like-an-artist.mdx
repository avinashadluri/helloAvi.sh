# Steal Like an Artist – A Comprehensive Summary

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253)

Austin Kleon’s *Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative* is not your typical book on art or productivity. It is a short, sharp, and visually playful manifesto for anyone who wants to create—writers, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, or even hobbyists.

Its core message is simple but powerful: **nothing is truly original. Creativity is about collecting ideas, remixing them, and expressing them in your own way.** Instead of stressing about being a genius or inventing something from thin air, Kleon encourages us to borrow, transform, and let our influences shape us.

## The Core Premise

Creativity is more collage than lightning bolt. We “steal” by absorbing ideas, remixing them, and making them ours. The trick is to distinguish between good theft and bad theft:

* **Good theft** transforms, honors, and credits.
* **Bad theft** plagiarizes, copies, and degrades.

## The 10 Lessons from *Steal Like an Artist*

### 1. Steal like an artist

Nothing comes from nowhere. Collect influences widely, remix them boldly, and make them personal.

### 2. Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started

Identity is not discovered first and then applied—it emerges by doing the work. Start before you’re “ready.”

### 3. Write the book you want to read

Don’t chase trends. Create the work you wish already existed. If you’d use it, chances are others will too.

### 4. Use your hands

Balance the digital world with analog play. Draw, scribble, cut, and build—your hands can unlock what your keyboard cannot.

### 5. Side projects and hobbies are important

Hobbies are not distractions. They cross-pollinate creativity and often lead to breakthroughs.

### 6. Do good work and share it with people

Consistency beats hype. Make valuable work, then share it—online audiences and opportunities will follow.

### 7. Geography is no longer our master

The internet erases borders. You can learn, collaborate, and publish to the world from anywhere.

### 8. Be nice (the world is a small town)

Generosity and kindness build networks; reputation travels fast. Praise, support, and credit others. Ignore the trolls.

### 9. Be boring (it’s the only way to get work done)

Routine, stability, and discipline are underrated. Creativity thrives on calendars, checklists, and habits.

### 10. Creativity is subtraction

Constraints spark originality. Limited tools, time, or resources often lead to stronger, leaner ideas.

## Tools and Supporting Ideas

* **Swipe File** – Keep a personal library of quotes, images, references, and snippets to borrow from later.
* **Imitation as training** – Copying your heroes is like a musician playing covers. Over time, imitation mutates into originality.
* **Scenius** – Borrowed from Brian Eno: creativity happens in communities, not just solitary geniuses. Surround yourself with a “scene.”
* **Analog + digital workflow** – Start messy on paper, then refine and share digitally.
* **Constraints as allies** – Instead of lamenting limitations, use them as creative springboards.

## Why This Book Resonates

Kleon’s little square book is designed like a sketchpad—quotes, doodles, and punchy lines. It’s quick to read, but it lingers for years.

It works because it:

* Relieves the pressure of being “totally original.”
* Validates the messy way most of us actually create.
* Offers practical rituals to stay unstuck in a noisy, digital world.

---

## Practical Takeaways

* Map your **inspiration family tree**: your heroes, their heroes, and so on.
* Protect work time with **boring, repeatable routines.**
* Share early and often—not just polished final pieces.
* Treat hobbies and side projects as legitimate creative fuel.
* Always create what you personally want to consume.

## Final Thoughts

*Steal Like an Artist* is more than advice—it’s permission. Permission to copy, remix, and learn. Permission to start without knowing the destination. And permission to build a life where creativity isn’t a rare spark but a daily practice.

It’s the kind of book you can finish in an afternoon yet return to whenever you feel stuck, needing that reminder: **don’t worry about being original—just start making.**
