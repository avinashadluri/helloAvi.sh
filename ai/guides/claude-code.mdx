# Guide · Claude Code

Claude 3.5 excels at reasoning-heavy engineering tasks. Here’s my setup.

## 1. Custom Instructions
```
- Assume TypeScript-first stack.
- Prefer step-by-step reasoning, but keep final answers concise.
- Suggest tests + observability hooks.
- Flag risks before proposing major changes.
```
Apply these both in Anthropic Console and Cursor.

## 2. Common Workflows
- **RFC drafting**: provide context, constraints, desired outcomes; Claude returns outline + risks.
- **Code refactors**: paste function + tests; ask for safer alternative.
- **Design system docs**: feed component API + usage guidelines for copy polish.
- **Agent eval writing**: generate adversarial prompts + scoring rubrics.

## 3. Tooling
- Use the Claude VS Code extension or Cursor integration.
- For long files, host gists + share URLs; Claude handles retrieval better.
- Enable "Code Execution" in Anthropic Console for quick prototypes.

## 4. Guardrails
- Don’t paste secrets or proprietary customer data.
- Cross-check suggestions; treat Claude as pair-programmer, not autopilot.
- Log key decisions in PR/Linear for audit trail.

## 5. Sample Prompt
```
You are pairing with me on the productivity stack. Given the following React server component...
1. Identify DX issues.
2. Propose improved structure.
3. Suggest tests + telemetry.
Code:
```

Happy pairing!
