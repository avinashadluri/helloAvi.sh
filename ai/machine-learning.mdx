# Machine Learning Foundations

Even in an LLM world, classical ML powers plenty of Sentience Studio workflows. Here’s the playbook.

## 1. Problem Framing
- Define **Decision Surface**: what action/outcome are we predicting?
- Capture **Data Reality**: source, volume, freshness, labeling cost.
- Identify **Success Metric**: accuracy, F1, RMSE, cost savings.

## 2. Dataset Ops
- **Ingest**: Airbyte → BigQuery, version via LakeFS.
- **Label**: Snorkel + human-in-the-loop in Label Studio.
- **Split**: Temporal splits for time series, stratified for classification.
- **Data cards**: Document biases, schema, owners.

## 3. Modeling Stack
- Tabular: CatBoost, XGBoost with Optuna tuning.
- Time-series: Prophet + Nixtla NeuralForecast.
- Recommendation: implicit matrix factorization + rerank via embeddings.

## 4. Deployment
- Package models with BentoML, deploy to AWS Lambda / ECS.
- Monitor with Evidently AI; send drifts to Slack.
- Build guardrails: auto-disable if metrics degrade beyond threshold.

## 5. Use Cases
- FlowOS habit scoring.
- AviWealth cashflow anomaly detection.
- Thinki.sh challenge recommendations.
