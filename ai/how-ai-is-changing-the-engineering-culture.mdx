# How AI Is Changing the Engineering Culture

AI in code isn’t just about writing functions faster. It’s shifting the culture of engineering in ways I didn’t expect.

Here are a few changes I’ve noticed:

⸻

1. Side projects don’t look the same

A few years ago, a solo hacker spending nights and weekends was the story.
Now, with AI, one person can spin up something real in a couple of days. The skill isn’t typing faster — it’s giving enough context for AI to actually help.

⸻

2. Code review feels different

Instead of waiting for feedback after a PR, you can get instant suggestions while coding.
It changes the mindset: you don’t just write and hope — you shape and adjust as you go.

⸻

3. The boring parts are disappearing

Scaffolding, CRUD, wiring up boilerplate — AI takes care of it.
What matters more is the design: how data flows, how security holds up, how systems scale.

⸻

4. Clarity beats cleverness

AI is only as good as the instructions.
If you describe the system clearly, it works like a strong teammate. If you’re vague, it flails like a confused intern. That’s forced me to think clearer about architecture before I touch code.

⸻

5. Speed is the new normal

Instead of one big release, it’s become normal to loop fast: generate → test → refine.
Done is better than perfect, because you can fix and improve quickly.


What this means

The role of an engineer isn’t disappearing — it’s shifting.
Less about syntax, more about judgment.
Less about grinding, more about framing problems and steering systems.

I’m curious — for engineers actually building with AI day-to-day, what’s the biggest change you’ve noticed in how you work, not just what you build?
