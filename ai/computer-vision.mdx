# Computer Vision Notes

Vision quietly supports many Avi projects—from GlucosePro charts to YouTube content.

## 1. Document & UI Parsing
- **Tools**: LayoutLMv3 + Donut for parsing invoices, statements, and design mocks.
- **Use case**: AviWealth uploads, extracting data into Notion + Sheets.

## 2. Health & Wellness
- **Glycemic logging**: Use OCR (Tesseract) to capture readings; cross-check with manual entries.
- **Meal logging**: YOLOv8 models classify meal types for nutrition analysis.

## 3. Content Automation
- **Storyboarding**: Detect key frames from footage to auto-generate thumbnails.
- **Subtitle alignment**: Whisper + gentle forced alignment for bilingual subtitles on Nishabdham videos.

## 4. Tooling Stack
- Python + FastAPI microservices.
- Runs on Modal / RunPod GPUs when heavy, Cloudflare Workers w/ WebAssembly for lightweight filters.
- Monitoring via Evidently (image drift) + Sentry.

## 5. Getting Started Template
1. Collect dataset (images, annotations via Label Studio).
2. Train/fine-tune with Ultralytics or Detectron2.
3. Deploy via BentoML; expose restful endpoint.
4. Wire into FlowOS automation or Sentience Studio agent.

Share improvements or datasets—vision is a team sport.
