# NLP Systems

Language is core to everything I build—technical docs, Telugu poetry, preventive thinking frameworks. Here’s how I approach NLP.

## 1. Text Processing Pipeline
- **Ingest**: Markdown/MDX from repos, transcripts from Whisper, Notion exports.
- **Cleaning**: LangChain text splitters (recursive) + custom Telugu normalizer.
- **Embedding**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small + Cohere rerankers.
- **Storage**: Supabase pgvector + Pinecone for large datasets.

## 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Source: Thinki.sh frameworks, FlowOS runbooks, Nishabdham essays.
- Guardrails: cite sources, highlight confidence, mark sensitive items.
- Tools: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK for streaming responses.

## 3. Sentiment + Topic Models
- Hugging Face transformers fine-tuned on bilingual dataset (English + Telugu).
- Use cases: feedback triage, community moderation, poetry curation.

## 4. Evaluation
- Rouge/BLEU for summarization.
- Custom rubric for translation accuracy (Telugu ↔ English).
- Human review loops for culturally sensitive content.

## 5. Deployment Patterns
- Edge functions for quick responses.
- Batch jobs for offline processing (SageMaker Processing or Modal).
- Slack/WhatsApp bots exposing NLP capabilities to teams/community.

Reuse these patterns for your own multilingual or knowledge-heavy projects.
