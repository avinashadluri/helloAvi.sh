# The Tech Stack Behind My Blog: Mintlify + Vercel + AI Codex

Running a blog in 2025 is less about fiddling with infrastructure and more about creating a smooth developer workflow. My setup combines Mintlify (for content + docs engine), Vercel (for previews & edge hosting), GitHub (for version control), and even ChatGPT Codex (to draft posts directly into my repo).

## ⚡ Tech Stack Overview

- Content & site engine → Mintlify
- Versioning & PRs → GitHub
- Custom domain & hosting → Mintlify (DNS via Vercel)
- Previews & micro-apps → Vercel
- AI-powered content pipeline → ChatGPT Codex → Git → PR → Mintlify deploy

## 🚀 Why Mintlify?

Most people think of Mintlify as developer documentation tooling. That’s true — but the beauty of Mintlify is that it’s flexible enough to be used as a blog framework.

I was impressed when I looked at how companies like Vercel, Cursor, and Anthropic organize their docs. Clean navigation, consistent categorization, and polished typography made me realize:

Why not structure my blog like a docs site?

Instead of a cluttered CMS or a noisy blog platform, I wanted a place to organize my thoughts into categories, just like APIs or product docs are organized into sections. It makes navigation easier for me as the writer — and for readers who want to jump between posts.

Why I prefer Mintlify for a blog (not just docs):

:::card
- Structured categorization → Perfect for organizing long-form posts like “guides,” “ideas,” or “essays.”
- Docs-like navigation → Sidebar, groups, search — everything people expect from technical content.
- Simple writing workflow → Markdown/MDX + GitHub, no heavy CMS.
- Polished defaults → Typography, dark mode, mobile responsiveness, cards — all out of the box.
- Zero distractions → No comments section, no social clutter. If someone wants to reach me, they can email or DM.
- AI search & assistant → Helps readers find content fast.
:::

### Why I don’t enable comments

I deliberately keep my blog comment-free. It’s not that I don’t want to hear from readers — I’d just rather keep it personal and direct. If someone wants to have a conversation, they can send me an email or reach out on social platforms. This keeps the blog focused on content, not debates.

## 💰 Pricing Snapshot

:::card
Free / Hobby → For individuals & small projects
Pro (~$250/mo) → 5 seats, AI assistant, preview deploys, analytics, styling
- Extra seats → $15/mo each
- AI overages → $0.15/response
Enterprise (custom) → SSO, SLAs, migrations, dedicated support

⚠️ Multiple sites = multiple subscriptions. If you want blog.mydomain.com and docs.mydomain.com, each is billed separately.

## 🔧 Deployment Workflow

1. **Repo + Config**

   Content lives in `/posts` with a `docs.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "My Blog",
     "theme": "mintlify",
     "colors": { "primary": "#1ec794" },
     "navigation": [
       { "group": "Blog", "pages": ["index", "posts/my-first-post"] },
       { "group": "Ideas", "pages": ["posts/ideas/structured-writing"] },
       { "group": "About", "pages": ["about"] }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Local Preview**

   ```bash
   npm i -g mintlify
   mintlify dev
   ```

3. **GitHub Sync**

   Every push = auto build on Mintlify.

4. **Domain Setup**

   Point subdomain → Mintlify:

   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `blog`
   - Target: `cname.vercel-dns.com`

5. **AI Content Pipeline (ChatGPT Codex)**

   1. Draft post in ChatGPT Codex.
   2. Codex writes Markdown directly into my local `/posts/`.
   3. Push branch → open a PR on GitHub.
   4. Merge → Mintlify auto-deploys the new article.

This gives me an AI-assisted publishing workflow: write → commit → merge → live.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

For me, Mintlify is not “just docs software” — it’s a new way to blog. Borrowing the categorization and navigation patterns of great docs sites (like Vercel, Cursor, Anthropic), I can structure my writing into sections, guides, and ideas instead of a chronological mess.

No comments, no clutter — just clean writing, discoverable content, and a simple contact path if someone wants to reach me.

Mintlify + Vercel + GitHub + ChatGPT Codex = a modern, lean, AI-assisted publishing stack.
