# Life OS Lanes

Borrow any of these lanes to reduce chaos at home while keeping space for creativity.

## Lane 1: Ops for Parents
- **Weekly Mission Control**: Sunday board review (school, activities, logistics).
- **Kid Kanban**: Trello board for Aadhya & Arjun (Learn, Play, Create columns).
- **Escalation paths**: Document who to call for school/health emergencies.

## Lane 2: Creative Hacks
- **Content batching**: Script reels Tuesday night, film Thursday morning.
- **Photography setup**: Camera presets stored in Notion, bag packed near door.
- **Story vault**: Voice memos transcribed via Whisper → Notion for Nishabdham drafts.

## Lane 3: Home Systems
- **Home wiki**: Appliances, maintenance schedules, contacts.
- **Meal rotations**: Groc auto-schedules menus with macros + grocery lists.
- **Finance quickscan**: Bi-weekly review of cashflow + upcoming bills (ties into AviWealth dashboard).

## Lane 4: Family Rituals
- Pizza + retros Friday nights (what made you smile? what was hard?).
- Monthly "maker day" where everyone builds something (robot, poem, short film).
- Photo dump + letter to kids every quarter.
