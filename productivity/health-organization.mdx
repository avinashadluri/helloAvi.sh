# FlowOS Energy Stack

Shipping meaningful work requires energy management. Here’s how I structure it.

## 1. GlucosePro Protocol
- Morning finger prick + Levels CGM experiments quarterly.
- Spreadsheet auto-imports readings; highlights spikes >140 mg/dL.
- Pair meals: protein first, carbs last; walking meetings post-lunch.

## 2. Movement
- **Weekly cadence**: 2 strength sessions, 2 cardio (Zone 2), 1 mobility day.
- **Stacking**: tie leadership one-on-ones to walking chats.
- **Tracking**: Apple Health → Notion dashboard via API.

## 3. Sleep & Recovery
- **Wind-down**: Screen-free 60 min, journaling, light stretch.
- **Whoop/Oura**: readiness scores piped into FlowOS dashboard; adjust workload accordingly.
- **Sabbath**: One tech-lite day per week (usually Saturday mornings with family).

## 4. Mindfulness
- 5-minute breathwork before deep work.
- Guided Telugu chants Sundays; shared with Nishabdham readers.
- Monthly float session or sauna/cold exposure for nervous system reset.

## 5. Templates
- Health OS Notion template (includes labs tracker, doctor contacts, vaccination log).
- Meal planning board tied to Groc automations.

Treat this as a menu—adopt what fits your physiology and lifestyle.
