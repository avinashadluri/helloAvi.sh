# Workflow Synths · Automations Lab

Automations should feel like a band, not a mess of scripts. Here’s the FlowOS set list.

## 1. n8n Masterclass
- **Stack**: Self-hosted on Fly.io + Postgres backend.
- **Blueprints**:
  - `Daily Ops`: pulls calendar, weather, and sends ritual digest.
  - `Family Logistics`: syncs school updates → shared Notion board.
  - `Agent Guardrails`: evaluates AI agent outputs before publishing.
- **Guides**: Loom walkthrough + exported `.json` flows included in repo.

## 2. OpenAI Agent Pipelines
- **Architecture**: Vercel edge function → OpenAI/Anthropic → Supabase vector store.
- **Use cases**: Thinki.sh prompt coach, MetaLabs changelog writer, PTE practice grader.
- **Eval Harness**: LangSmith, Truelens, and custom dataset to track hallucinations.

## 3. Bonus Flows
- **Zapier + Replit Agents**: Quick experiments hooking Airtable → Slack → agent follow-ups.
- **Make.com for Creators**: Auto-generate Instagram reels metadata + publish to Notion.
- **Airplane.dev Runbooks**: Ops automations for deployments, cost sweeps, access requests.

## 4. Governance
- Automations repo (`/automation`) with versioned flows + tests.
- Secrets managed via Doppler.
- Every workflow has an owner, SLO, and "pull-the-plug" switch.

Fork any of these flows, or request the private repo for deeper dives.
