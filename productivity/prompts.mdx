# FlowOS Prompt Pack

Prompts are automation too. Below are the ones I lean on across FlowOS and Sentience Studio.

## 1. Daily Clarity (Journal)
> "Given my energy level today, what is the smallest shippable win that moves {project} forward?"

## 2. Weekly Retro
> "What should I stop, start, and continue next week across Work, Think, Create? Answer with bullet points + next actions."

## 3. Agent Brief Template
```
You are {agent_name}, built for {audience}. You must:
- obey guardrails: {guardrails}
- cite data sources
- request clarification when input is ambiguous
Return output as markdown with Action Items + Risks.
```

## 4. FlowOS Family Sync
> "Summarize the key events for Aadhya & Arjun this week. Highlight logistics conflicts and suggest two creative activities." (Used with GPT-4o via Shortcuts.)

## 5. Creative Kickoff
> "Give me three storytelling angles for {topic} that blend tech, Telugu culture, and practical takeaways." (Feeds Nishabdham + blog drafts.)

## 6. Health & Energy Check
> "Based on today’s nutrition and sleep logs, what is one adjustment I should make tomorrow? Keep it specific and doable." (Paired with GlucosePro data.)

Feel free to drop these into PromptLib; improvements are always welcome.
