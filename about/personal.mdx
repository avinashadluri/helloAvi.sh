# Personal World

I grew up in a Telugu household where poetry was a daily ritual. Words were currency, so writing verse and reading classics became natural. That love now lives at [nishabdham.sh](https://nishabdham.sh), my digital garden for poetry, essays, and storytelling experiments.

## From India to Australia

Moving from India to Australia taught me to blend ambition with empathy. Sydney’s coastline is where most of my prototypes start—walks become brainstorming sessions, photography becomes documentation, and beaches become retrospectives.

## Family OS

Gouthami keeps our home’s heartbeat steady. Aadhya and Arjun turn weekends into curiosity labs: Lego rockets, short films, photography walks, and board-game strategy reviews. Home is where productivity rituals get tested before I write about them.

## Creative Canvas

- **Telugu Poetry & Literature** – Weekly writing sessions, translations, and live readings.
- **Photography & Videography** – Street, nature, and BTS footage for YouTube + Instagram.
- **Community Storytelling** – Hosting local events where tech meets art, often bilingual.
- **Mindfulness Practices** – Meditation, astronomy nights, and sustainability experiments (inspired by `avinash.sh` personal tab).

## Work · Think · Create

- **Work**: Ship dependable systems with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and AI copilots.
- **Think**: Protect deep work through productivity rituals, journaling, and long walks.
- **Create**: Publish poetry, film micro-documentaries, and build public tools.

## Why Share Both Worlds?

Every article, product, or experiment on this site is informed by both sides. Engineering discipline keeps things reliable; poetry and family life keep them human. If you resonate with either world, feel free to reach out—mentorship, collaborations, and coffee chats are always welcome.
