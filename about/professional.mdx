# Professional World

Fifteen-plus years of shipping software taught me that clarity beats cleverness. I started in Mumbai, sharpened my craft in Hyderabad, and now architect systems in Sydney. TypeScript is my lingua franca, and every stack I touch gets an AI co-pilot for reasoning, testing, and developer-experience gains.

## Role Highlights

### Atlassian · Senior Software Engineer
- Built and scaled design systems adopted by 100+ product teams.
- Cut CI/CD times by 70% through rethinking release playbooks and infrastructure.
- Championed accessibility and micro-frontend adoption across the org.

### Weel / Stealth FinTech · Staff Engineer
- Shipped AI-native tooling for finance workflows with a lean team.
- Owned developer-experience guardrails so independent squads could ship safely.

### Bugcrowd · Tech Lead
- Led the modernization of the security platform UI and observability stack.
- Mentored 20+ engineers, improving squad velocity by 40% while raising quality bars.

### Cognizant · Tech Lead (Sydney & Hyderabad)
- Coordinated onsite/offshore delivery for banking clients; introduced design-system thinking into legacy stacks.
- Ran hiring, mentoring, and cross-team guilds for 200+ developer org.

### Valuepitch · Software Engineer (Mumbai)
- Built enterprise portals and analytics suites that grounded my obsession with TypeScript and performance.

## Leadership Philosophy

> Engineer with radical clarity, mentor generously, and leave processes kinder for the next builder.

- I run architecture reviews like storytelling sessions—context, constraints, and trade-offs first.
- I lean on metrics (latency, usability, developer joy) instead of vibes when making decisions.
- Every project includes internal documentation, onboarding videos, and a playbook so others can take over confidently.

## Public Speaking & Mentorship

- Host internal workshops on AI-assisted development and prompt engineering (PromptLib began as one of these sessions).
- Speak at meetups about design systems, productivity rituals, and immigrant leadership journeys.
- Mentor aspiring engineers through 1:1 office hours and cohort-based programs.

## Current Focus Map

- **AI Lab** – Building Agent Ops kits, evaluation harnesses, and responsible AI workflows.
- **Productivity Lab** – Designing templates for families and creative professionals.
- **AviWealth** – Crafting immigrant-first calculators covering cash flow, offset strategies, and property scenarios.
- **Thinki.sh** – Translating preventive thinking frameworks into interactive tools.
