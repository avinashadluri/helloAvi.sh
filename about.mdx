Two modes anchor my work: a professional world obsessed with dependable systems and a personal world steeped in Telugu literature, family, and mindful creativity. This page shares both stories so you can see what informs every project on the site.

I'm Avinash Adluri, a passionate technologist with a deep love for building innovative solutions and exploring the frontiers of technology. My journey in tech spans across multiple domains—from frontend development to AI/ML, from startup ecosystems to enterprise solutions.

## Professional World

Fifteen-plus years of shipping software taught me that clarity beats cleverness. I started in Mumbai, sharpened my craft in Hyderabad, and now architect systems in Sydney. TypeScript is my lingua franca, and every stack I touch gets an AI co-pilot for reasoning, testing, and developer-experience gains.

### Role Highlights

#### Atlassian · Senior Software Engineer
- Built and scaled design systems adopted by 100+ product teams.
- Cut CI/CD times by 70% through rethinking release playbooks and infrastructure.
- Championed accessibility and micro-frontend adoption across the org.

#### Weel / Stealth FinTech · Staff Engineer
- Shipped AI-native tooling for finance workflows with a lean team.
- Owned developer-experience guardrails so independent squads could ship safely.

#### Bugcrowd · Tech Lead
- Led the modernization of the security platform UI and observability stack.
- Mentored 20+ engineers, improving squad velocity by 40% while raising quality bars.

#### Cognizant · Tech Lead (Sydney & Hyderabad)
- Coordinated onsite/offshore delivery for banking clients; introduced design-system thinking into legacy stacks.
- Ran hiring, mentoring, and cross-team guilds for 200+ developer org.

#### Valuepitch · Software Engineer (Mumbai)
- Built enterprise portals and analytics suites that grounded my obsession with TypeScript and performance.

### Leadership Philosophy

> Engineer with radical clarity, mentor generously, and leave processes kinder for the next builder.

- I run architecture reviews like storytelling sessions—context, constraints, and trade-offs first.
- I lean on metrics (latency, usability, developer joy) instead of vibes when making decisions.
- Every project includes internal documentation, onboarding videos, and a playbook so others can take over confidently.

### Public Speaking & Mentorship

- Host internal workshops on AI-assisted development and prompt engineering (PromptLib began as one of these sessions).
- Speak at meetups about design systems, FlowOS rituals, and immigrant leadership journeys.
- Mentor aspiring engineers through 1:1 office hours and cohort-based programs.

### Current Focus Map

- **Sentience Studio** – Building Agent Ops kits, evaluation harnesses, and responsible AI workflows.
- **FlowOS Lab** – Designing templates for families and creative professionals.
- **AviWealth** – Crafting immigrant-first calculators covering cash flow, offset strategies, and property scenarios.
- **Thinki.sh** – Translating preventive thinking frameworks into interactive tools.

## Personal World

I grew up in a Telugu household where poetry was a daily ritual. Words were currency, so writing verse and reading classics became natural. That love now lives at [nishabdham.sh](https://nishabdham.sh), my digital garden for poetry, essays, and storytelling experiments.

### From India to Australia

Moving from India to Australia taught me to blend ambition with empathy. Sydney’s coastline is where most of my prototypes start—walks become brainstorming sessions, photography becomes documentation, and beaches become retrospectives.

### Family OS

Gouthami keeps our home’s heartbeat steady. Aadhya and Arjun turn weekends into curiosity labs: Lego rockets, short films, photography walks, and board-game strategy reviews. Home is where FlowOS rituals get tested before I write about them.

### Creative Canvas

- **Telugu Poetry & Literature** – Weekly writing sessions, translations, and live readings.
- **Photography & Videography** – Street, nature, and BTS footage for YouTube + Instagram.
- **Community Storytelling** – Hosting local events where tech meets art, often bilingual.
- **Mindfulness Practices** – Meditation, astronomy nights, and sustainability experiments (inspired by `avinash.sh` personal tab).

### Work · Think · Create

- **Work**: Ship dependable systems with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and AI copilots.
- **Think**: Protect deep work through FlowOS rituals, journaling, and long walks.
- **Create**: Publish poetry, film micro-documentaries, and build public tools.

## Why Share Both Worlds?

Every article, product, or experiment on this site is informed by both sides. Engineering discipline keeps things reliable; poetry and family life keep them human. If you resonate with either world, feel free to reach out—mentorship, collaborations, and coffee chats are always welcome.
