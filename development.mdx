# Local Development Setup

This guide will help you set up this Mintlify documentation site locally for development and content creation.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before
  proceeding.
</Info>

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of the documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Updating Mintlify

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Content Structure

This blog is organized into the following sections:

- **Home**: Welcome page and about section
- **Dev**: Development topics, tools, and best practices
- **Tech**: Technology insights and industry trends
- **AI**: Artificial intelligence and machine learning content
- **Frontend**: Frontend development frameworks and techniques
- **Backend**: Backend technologies and infrastructure

## Writing Content

Content is written in MDX format, which allows you to use:

- Standard Markdown syntax
- React components
- Mintlify's built-in components like `<Card>`, `<Accordion>`, `<Note>`, etc.

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys when changes are pushed to the main branch. You can also manually deploy through the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
